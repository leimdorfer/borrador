# Focussing on value not delivery

Notes from a session with Alex Watson

It's easy to shift into “get stuff done” mode, But core metrics remain flat. This can be particularly true in News where events drive the agenda.
Competitors for people's attention are engaged in very active change towards usage and retention, so consumption of News is getting squeezed
On mobile phones, only 12mins out of 3 hours is spent consuming news.
A shift in focus towards mobile is needed to reach the audience

*Think hard about the data*
Be careful about the job becoming "internally focussed"
Try to think about value as opposed to delivery – and how metrics can help
Ratios are a good way of illustrating gaps
Or something punchy: "1 young person lost to the BBC every minute!"
BBC (OPR) target is clear and understandable (90% under 35% consuming content every week.)
Loads of trawling through data – goes into a nice (simpler) deck.
Lots of detailed thinking goes into producing a simple number.
Which features are the candidates for driving this number

*Focus on velocity of learning*
Move the team focus "from mechanics/maintenance to F1" (faster faster)
But focus on "Velocity of learning" (not just velocity of delivery) – because can’t drive change without learning!
MVP is a process – can we engender this change

*Be careful about distractions*
Don’t get dragged into doing people favours to become popular
Don’t eyeball the product – it’s always too complex.
