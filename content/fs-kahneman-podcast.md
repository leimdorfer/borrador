# Class 1

If you want to encourage a behaviour to take people from A to B

You can push them to B
Or you can ask "Why aren't they doing B already?"
The answer is "Becuase of retraining forces"

Removing restraining forces is a better way of chaning behaviour than "pushing"

(visualisation of plank with springs - less tension if you remove springs)

# Class 2

"Fundamental Attribution Error" - you think people acting in a certain way is because of who they are rather than the circumstances they are in.
Be less judgemental.

Potential losers fight a lot harder than potential winners - which is frequently not anticipated in public policy (and can add significant cost).

"There is less clear thinking than people like to think"
What gets in the way of clear thinking is: 
our intuitive "ready made answers"
we believe things without good reason
We adopt the beliefs of the people we trust
commitments to previous views

#Better decisions

Use algorithms, if you can't use algrithms, Slow down.

Divide up the problem evaluate all the aspects separately only once you've that "close your eyes" and have an intuition - "Delay your intuition" people form their intuition too quickly. take the separate dimensions separately and independently.

Protect the dissenters - make it painless to dissent.

More optimistically about Organisations. They think more slowly and have "procedures for thinking" processes in pace to ensure individuals don't make intuitive decisions.

Pre-mortems

Keep intelligence gathering independent of the decision making
When you are going to be talking about a topic - right down the decision you are in favour of before you start the conversation = broader views (less group think) and better preparation - people actually prepare
Better meetings, but people don't like it because it's more work.

"Virtually all the advise I give isn't followed"

I would advise people who make a lot of decisions to Keep track and come back to them.
people hate doing this because they frequently end up looking foolish.
Keep a "decision journal" - enough to come later and debrief yourself. and a calibration of how sure you are.
People are really very worried about embarrasment


#Negotiation

Don't apply pressure - try to understand what can you do to remove the obstacles to them thinking like you.
