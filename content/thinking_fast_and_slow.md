Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

WTSIATI
-------

It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness.

Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern.

*WYSIATI* facilitates the achievement of coherence and of the cognitive ease that causes us to accept a statement as true. It explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. Much of the time, the coherent story we put together is close enough to reality to support reasonable action.

However, WYSIATI helps explain a long and diverse list of biases of judgement and choice, including the following among many others:

#Overconfidence:
Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that our judgement is missing: what is all there is. Furthermore, our associative system tends to settle on a coherent pattern of activation and suppresses doubt and ambiguity.

#Framing effects:
Different ways of presenting the same information often evoke different emotions. The statement that "the odds of survival one month after surgery are 90%" is more reassuring than the equivalent statement that "mortality within one month of surgery is 10%." Similarly, cold cuts described as "90% fat-free" are more attractive than when they are described as "10% fat." The equivalence of the alternative formulations is transparent, but an individual normally sees only one formulation, and what she sees is all there is.

#Base-rate neglect:
Recall Steve, the meek and tidy soul who is often believed to be a librarian. The personality description is salient and vivid, and although you surely know that there are more male farmers than male librarians, that statistical fact almost certainly did not come to your mind when you first considered the question. What you saw was all there was. settle on a coherent pattern of activation and suppresses doubt and ambiguity.

Characteristics of system 1
------

  * Generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by system 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions
 * operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control
 * can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search)
 * executes sldlled responses and generates sldlled intuitions, after adequate training
 * creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance
 * distinguishes the surprising from the normal
 * infers and invents causes and intentions
 * neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt
 * is biased to believe and confirm
 * exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)
 * focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence (WYSIATI)
 * generates a limited set of basic assessments
 * represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate
 * matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness)
 * computes more than intended (mental shotgun)
 * sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics)
 * is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)
 * overweights low probabilities
 * shows diminishing 'sensitivity to quantity
 * responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion)*
 * frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one another

AVAILABILITY, EMOTION, AND RISK
In his desire to wrest sole control of risk policy from experts, Slovic has
challenged the foundation of their expertise: the idea that risk is objective.
"Risk" does not exist "out there," independent of our minds and culture,
waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of "risk"
to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of
life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as "real risk" or
"objective risk."
To illustrate his claim, Slovic lists nine ways of defining the mortality
risk associated with the release of a toxic material into the ranging from
"death per million people" to "death per million dollars of product pro-
duced." His point is that the evaluation of the risk depends on the choice of
a measure-with the obvious possibility that the choice may have been
guided by a preference for one outcome or another. He goes on to conclude
that "defining risk is thus an exercise in power." You might not have guessed
that one can get to such thorny policy issues from experimental studies
of the psychology of judgment! However, policy is ultimately about people,
what they want and what is best for them. Every policy question involves
assumptions about human nature, in particular about the choices that
people may make and the consequences of their choices for themselves and
for society.

143-144 risk and availability cascades
----

Anyone who has waited for a teenage daughter who is late from a party will recognize, you may know that there is really (almost) nothing to worry about, but we cannot help images of disaster from coming to mind.

The amount of concern is not adequately sensitive to the probability of harm; you are imagining the numerator: the tragic story you saw on the news, and not thinking about the denominator. Sunstein has coinedthe phrase *"probability neglect"* to describe the pattern. The combination of probability neglect with the social mechanisms of *availability cascades* inevitably leads to gross exaggeration of minor threats, sometimes with important consequences.

In today's world, terrorists are the most significant practitioners of the
art of inducing availability cascades. with a few horrible exceptions such as
9/11, the number of casualties from terror attacks is very small relative to
other causes of death. Even in countries that have been targets of intensive
terror campaigns, such as Israel, the weekly number of casualties almost
never came close to the number of traffic deaths. The difference is in the
availability of the two risks, the ease and the frequency with which they
come to mind. Gruesome images, endlessly repeated in the media, cause
everyone to be on edge. As I know from experience, it is difficult to reason
oneself into a state of complete calm. Terrorism speaks directly to System 1.
Where do I come down in the debate between my friends? Availability
cascades are real and they undoubtedly distort priorities in the allocation
of public resources. Cass Sunstein would seek mechanisms that insulate
decision makers from public pressures, letting the allocation of resources
be determined by impartial experts who have a broad view of all risks and
of the resources available to reduce them. Paul Slovic trusts the experts
much less and the public somewhat more than Sunstein does, and he points
out that insulating the experts from the emotions of the public produces
policies that the public will reject_an impossible situation in a democracy
Both are eminently sensible, and I agree with both.
I share Sunstein's discomfort with the influence of irrational fears and
availability cascades on public policy in the domain of risk. However, I also
share Slovic's belief that widespread fears, even if they are unreasonable,
should not be ignored by policy makers. Rational or not, fear is painful and
debilitating, and policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from
fear, not only from real dangers.
Slovic rightly stresses the resistance of the public to the idea of decisions
being made by unelected and unaccountable experts. Furthermore, avail-
ability cascades may have a long-term benefit by calling attention to classes of risks

THINKING, FAST AND SLOW
students managed to learn nothing at all. But when the students were sur
prised by individual cases_two nice people who had not helped~they im-
mediately made the generalization and inferred that helping is more difficult
than they had thought. Nisbett and Borgida summarize the results in a
memorable sentence:
Subjects' unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was
matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular.
This is a profoundly important conclusion. People who are taught sur-
prising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the
point of telling their friends about what they have heard, but this does not
mean that their understanding of the world has really changed. The test of
learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you
counter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact. There is a
deep gap between our thinldng about statistics and our thinldng about in-
dividual cases. Statistical results with a causal interpretation have a stronger effect on our thinldng than noncausal information. But even compelling causal statistics will not change long-held beliefs or beliefs rooted in per-
sonal experience. On the other hand, surprising individual cases.have a
powerful impact and are a more effective tool for teaching psychology be-
cause the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in a causal story
That is why this book contains questions that are addressed personally to
the reader. You are more likely to learn something by Finding surprises in
your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in
general.
