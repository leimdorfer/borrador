# Notes from Alex talking about focussing on value not delivery

It's easy to shift into “get stuff done” mode.
Core metrics remain flat
Particularly true in News where events
Competitors engaged in very active change towards usage and retention
So BBC getting squeezed
12mins on news/3hours  (on phones)
So if we don’t shift we risk not reaching audience

Job also becomes about incredibly internally focussed
Try to think about value as opposed to delivery – and how metrics can help
Ratios are a good way of illustrating gaps
1 young person lost to the BBC every minute – something punchy
OPR target is clear and understandable (90% under 35%…)
From Mechanics to maintenance to F1 (faster faster)
Velocity of learning – because can’t drive change without learning!
Lots of detailed thinking goes into producing a simple number – e.g. deep dive on app
Loads of trawling through data – goes into a nice (simpler) deck.

MVP is a process – can we engender this change
Which features are the candidates for driving this number

Don’t get dragged into doing people favours to become popular
Don’t eyeball the product – it’s too complex.
